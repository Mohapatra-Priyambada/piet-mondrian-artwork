            <h2>About the Painter</h2>
            <p><b>Piet Mondrian (1872–1944)</b> was a Dutch painter and one of the pioneers of abstract art. He is best known for developing Neoplasticism, also called De Stijl, a style that emphasized geometric forms, straight lines, and a limited palette of primary colors—red, blue, and yellow—combined with black and white. Initially influenced by Impressionism and Cubism, Mondrian gradually moved towards pure abstraction, aiming to express universal harmony and order. His iconic compositions, such as Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow, have had a lasting impact on modern art, architecture, and design. Mondrian’s work continues to inspire minimalism and contemporary aesthetics across various creative fields.</p>

            <p>Piet Mondrian's grid art style, known as <b>Neoplasticism</b> or <b>De Stijl</b>, is characterized by a strict use of geometric abstraction, primarily employing vertical and horizontal black lines to form a grid-like structure. Within these grids, Mondrian used a limited palette of primary colors—red, blue, and yellow—along with white and black to create a sense of balance and harmony. His compositions, such as <b>Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow</b>, reject traditional representation in favor of pure abstraction, emphasizing simplicity, order, and universal beauty. Mondrian’s work had a profound influence on modern art, architecture, and design, inspiring movements like minimalism and influencing fields ranging from fashion to graphic design.</p>

                <h3>Composition in Red, Blue, and Yellow</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Medium:</b>Oil on Canvas</li>
                    <li><b>Year:</b> 1930</li>
                    <li><b>Movement:</b> De Stijl (Neoplasticism)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A defining work of the De Stijl movement, this composition embodies a vision of pure abstraction and harmony. Bold black lines segment the canvas into dynamic yet balanced geometric forms, filled with the primary colors of red, blue, and yellow, alongside black, white, and gray. Through this meticulous structure, the artwork conveys a sense of universal order and equilibrium, a hallmark of the artist’s philosophy. The deliberate asymmetry and careful arrangement of colors create a rhythmic tension, making this piece a striking example of modern abstraction.</p>

                <h3>Dynamic Harmony</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Medium:</b>Oil on Canvas</li>
                    <li><b>Movement:</b> De Stijl (Neoplasticism)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This composition expands on the principles of De Stijl, presenting a dynamic yet meticulously balanced interplay of primary colors—red, blue, and yellow—contrasted with black and white. The grid-like structure of bold black lines segments the canvas into an intricate arrangement of rectangles and squares, creating a sense of rhythm and movement. Unlike traditional symmetry, the asymmetrical balance here evokes an energetic yet harmonious visual experience. Through this abstraction, the work embodies the artist’s vision of universal order and purity, making it a striking testament to modernist ideals.</p>
